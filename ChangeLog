	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: removed the unneeded ip_address union
	  and replaced it with "struct in_addr".  As arp-scan is only
	  applicable to IPv4, we don't need to use the union.  This
	  change reduces the size of an address from 16 bytes to 4, and
	  reduces the per-host memory usage from 44 bytes/host to 32.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added Windows Vista Beta 2 fingerprint.

	  for future changes.

	* Released version 1.4.
	  This is the first stable version.  v1.3 was a beta, and v1.0,
	  1.1 and 1.2 were NTA Monitor internal versions before it was
	  released under GPL.
