	* Updated ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt from the IEEE website
	  using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

	* configure.ac: Incremented version number to 1.5.1 in preparation
	  for post-1.5 changes.

2006-07-24 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* ieee-oui.txt, ieee-iab.txt: Updated IEEE OUI and IAB listings from
	  IEEE website using get-oui and get-iab Perl scripts.

2006-07-22 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Increased version number to 1.4.5.

	* README: Added installation instructions.

2006-07-21 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-bpf.c: New file containing link-level sending functions
	  for BPF as used by BSD OSes.

	* link-packet-socket.c: Changed socket protocol from SOCK_DGRAM to
	  SOCK_RAW, so the entire Ethernet frame including the header can
          be controlled.

	* arp-scan.c: Changed to build entire outgoing frame, rather than
	  just the ARP payload.

	* arp-scan.c: Modifications to support BPF link-layer.  This has been
	  tested on FreeBSD 6.1, OpenBSD 3.9, NetBSD 3.0.1 and
          Darwin 7.9.0 (MacOS 10.3.9).

	* arp-scan.c: Changed operation of the --srcaddr option.  Now it
	  sets the hardware address in the frame header of outgoing packets
	  without altering the address of the outgoing interface.

	* link-packet-socket.c, link-bpf.c: Removed set_hardware_address()
	  function, as this is no longer needed with the new operation of
	  the --srcaddr option.

2006-07-11 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c: Removed unneeded gettimeofday() call in add_host().
	  This increases the host addition rate considerably, so adding
	  a class-A network (2^24 hosts) now takes 15 seconds as opposed
	  to 80 seconds.

2006-07-10 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.h, arp-scan.c: Removed unneeded element "n" from host
	  entry structure.  This reduces the per-host memory usage from
	  32 bytes per host to 28 bytes per host.

	* mac-vendor.5: New manual page for the mac-vendor.txt file format.

2006-07-03 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* link-packet-socket.c: New file containing all functions that
	  use Linux packet socket link layer interface.  This moves all
	  the packet-socket implementation dependent to this one file, which
	  should make future porting to other operating systems easier.

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: Modified to use link-layer functions in
	  new link-packet-socket.c file.

	* configure.ac: Increased version number to 1.4.2.

2006-06-28 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* arp-scan.c, arp-scan.h: removed the unneeded ip_address union
	  and replaced it with "struct in_addr".  As arp-scan is only
	  applicable to IPv4, we don't need to use the union.  This
	  change reduces the size of an address from 16 bytes to 4, and
	  reduces the per-host memory usage from 44 bytes/host to 32.

	* arp-fingerprint: Added Windows Vista Beta 2 fingerprint.

2006-06-27 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* configure.ac: Increase version number to 1.4.1 in preparation
	  for future changes.

2006-06-26 Roy Hills <Roy.Hills@nta-monitor.com>

	* Released version 1.4.
	  This is the first stable version.  v1.3 was a beta, and v1.0,
	  1.1 and 1.2 were NTA Monitor internal versions before it was
	  released under GPL.
