Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.
There is disagreement about what the first line in the manpage should be.
Solaris 9 says in man(1):
'\" X
Linux sarge says in groff_man(7):
.\" word
In all cases, the letters in word are "e" for eqn, "r" for refer, "t" for tbl.

Why does darwin 7.9 not have prototypes for pcap_datalink_val_to_name(),
pcap_datalink_val_to_description() and pcap_setnonblock() even though the
pcap library contains these functions?  arp-scan compiles with warnings, but
runs OK.

Add support for win32 link-layer send and receive.

Add support for Token Ring.

Support the libpcap sending function pcap_sendpacket() or pcap_inject() when
they are supported by the pcap library.  These two functions are essentially
the same, but pcap_sendpacket() came from WinPcap whereas pcap_inject() came
from OpenBSD.  Need to find portable functions to get interface IP address
and MAC address.  pcap_lookupnet() gets the network address and mask, but not
the IP address.

Investigate response packets >60 bytes long, e.g. Windows 2003 Server and
some Cisco.

Investigate ARP trailer negotiation, as defined in RFC1122 section 2.3.1,
Trailer Protocol Negotiation: 'the ARP exchange is completed in the usual
manner using the normal IP protocol type, but a host that wants to speak
trailers will send an additional "trailer ARP reply" packet'.  Trailer
encapsulation itself is detailed in RFC 893.

Support LLC/SNAP encapsulation with 802.1Q VLAN tagging (--llc --vlan=n) and
generate the correct packet format.  Currently the VLAN tag is added first,
which is incorrect.

Add XML output format.
