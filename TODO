Add support for IEEE IAB listings in addition to OUI listings.
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/iab.txt
Each IAB defines the first 36 bits, leaving the remaining 12 free,
e.g. 00:50:c2:00:0x:xx

Add support for special MAC addresses e.g. VMware, WLBS Etc.
For this, we'll probably want to use Posix pattern matching.

ML: Add option to scan locally attached network without requiring IP range.
Get IP address and netmask of interface and generate range from that.
