Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

AC: arp-fingerprint shouldn't accept ranges like 10.0.0.0/24.

Avoid double unmarshalling of packet data: once in callback, then again
in display_packet().

Support libpcap0.7, which is used by some older distibutions.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.

Why does darwin 7.9 not have prototypes for pcap_datalink_val_to_name(),
pcap_datalink_val_to_description() and pcap_setnonblock() even though the
pcap library contains these functions?  arp-scan compiles with warnings, but
runs OK.

Add support for other common link-layer implementations: win32 and
dlpi (Solaris and other SysV Unix).

Alter the shebang line for the Perl scripts if /usr/bin/perl doesn't exist,
but there is a Perl in one of the other standard locations.  This is mainly
for NetBSD where pkg_add installs Perl as /usr/pkg/bin/perl and doesn't
make /usr/bin/perl a symlink to this.
