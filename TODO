Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

AC: arp-fingerprint shouldn't accept ranges like 10.0.0.0/24.

Avoid double unmarshalling of packet data: once in callback, then again
in display_packet().

Change behaviour of --srcaddr option so that it changes the source hardware
address of outgoing frames rather than changing the hardware address of the
interface.  This should be trivial now that we are sending raw frames, and
will make the --srcaddr option much safer.

Support libpcap0.7.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.

Why does darwin 7.9 not have prototypes for pcap_datalink_val_to_name(),
pcap_datalink_val_to_description() and pcap_setnonblock() even though the
pcap library contains these functions?  arp-scan compiles with warnings, but
runs OK.
