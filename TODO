Add support for special MAC addresses e.g. VRRP, WLBS Etc.
For this, we'll probably want to use Posix pattern matching.
We need to match before the OUI listings, because some use assigned prefixes,
e.g. VRRP with 00:00:5e:00:01:xx

ML: Add option to scan locally attached network without requiring IP range.
Get IP address and netmask of interface and generate range from that.
