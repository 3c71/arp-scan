Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

Use libnet or another packet creation library to allow arp-scan to run on
non-linux platforms.

AC: arp-fingerprint shouldn't accept ranges like 10.0.0.0/24.

Avoid double unmarshalling of packet data: once in callback, then again
in display_packet().

Change behaviour of --srcaddr option so that it changes the source hardware
address of outgoing frames rather than changing the hardware address of the
interface.  This should be trivial now that we are sending raw frames, and
will make the --srcaddr option much safer.

Support libpcap0.7.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.
