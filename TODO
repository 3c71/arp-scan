Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

NetBSD doesn't run man pages through tbl. This may apply to other OSes as well.
This used to be a problem with OpenBSD up to 4.8, but the mandoc formatter in
OpenBSD 4.9 and later has integrated tbl support.

Add support for win32 link-layer send and receive.

Add support for Token Ring.

Find portable function to get interface MAC address.

Investigate response packets >60 bytes long, e.g. Windows 2003 Server and
some Cisco.

Add XML output format.

./configure gives warnings on OS X Snow Leopard:

   checking for ANSI C header files... rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
   rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
   yes

   It is suspected that an upgrade to autoconf, automake and libtools will fix
   this.

MPLS tag support.

Use the new libpcap 1.0 API functions pcap_create(), pcap_set_XXX(), 
pcap_activate() instead of the old pcap_open_live() once we can be sure that
all supported OSes use libpcap 1.0 or later.
