Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

Use libnet or another packet creation library to allow arp-scan to run on
non-linux platforms.

AC: arp-fingerprint shouldn't accept ranges like 10.0.0.0/24.

ML: Reduce the amount of memory used per host.  Currently scanning a Class-A
needs more than 600MB of RAM.  We can probably trim down the size of the
host_entry structure.
