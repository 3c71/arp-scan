Add support for IEEE IAB listings in addition to OUI listings.
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/iab.txt
Each IAB defines the first 36 bits, leaving the remaining 12 free,
e.g. 00:50:c2:00:0x:xx

Add support for special MAC addresses e.g. VMware, WLBS Etc.
For this, we'll probably want to use Posix pattern matching.

ML: Add option to scan locally attached network without requiring IP range.
Get IP address and netmask of interface and generate range from that.

Handle duplicate IP addresses in input in a sensible manner.
Can we just ignore non-live hosts in find_host()? No, because that would hide
duplicate packets.

Allow changing of the local interface MAC address.
   for (i=0; i<6; i++) {
      net->dev.ifr_hwaddr.sa_data[i] = mac->byte[i];
   }
   if (ioctl(net->sock, SIOCSIFHWADDR, &net->dev) < 0) {
      perror ("ERROR: Can't change MAC: interface up or not permission");
      return -1;
   }

ML: I'd like to be able to set the source IP to the same as the destination IP:

arp-scan --arpspa same-as-dest 80.82.243.222/29
