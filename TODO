Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Add support for win32 link-layer send and receive.

Add support for Token Ring.

Find portable function to get interface MAC address.

Investigate response packets >60 bytes long, e.g. Windows 2003 Server and
some Cisco.

Add XML output format.

./configure gives warnings on OS X Snow Leopard:

   checking for ANSI C header files... rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
   rm: conftest.dSYM: is a directory
   yes

   It is suspected that an upgrade to autoconf, automake and libtools will fix
   this.

MPLS tag support.

Use the new libpcap 1.0 API functions pcap_create(), pcap_set_XXX(), 
pcap_activate() instead of the old pcap_open_live() once we can be sure that
all supported OSes use libpcap 1.0 or later.

Check for failure to obtain the interface MAC address. On FreeBSD, this will
return zero for deviced that don't have a MAC address like lo0 and usbus0.

Review the order of obtaining interface information, opening pcap, and
setting the filter, to give informative warnings and errors under common
cases such as no device, no priv, unsupported device type Etc.
