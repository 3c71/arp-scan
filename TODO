Add support for IEEE IAB listings in addition to OUI listings.
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/iab.txt
Each IAB defines the first 36 bits, leaving the remaining 12 free,
e.g. 00:50:c2:00:0x:xx

Add support for special MAC addresses e.g. VRRP, WLBS Etc.
For this, we'll probably want to use Posix pattern matching.
We need to match before the OUI listings, because some use assigned prefixes,
e.g. VRRP with 00:00:5e:00:01:xx

ML: Add option to scan locally attached network without requiring IP range.
Get IP address and netmask of interface and generate range from that.

Use a better hash implementation than hsearch.  Investigate GNU BFD and
GAS, both of which contain hash.c.
