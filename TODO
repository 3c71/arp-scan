Add support for IEEE IAB listings in addition to OUI listings.
http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/iab.txt
Each IAB defines the first 36 bits, leaving the remaining 12 free,
e.g. 00:50:c2:00:0x:xx

Add support for special MAC addresses e.g. VMware, WLBS Etc.
For this, we'll probably want to use Posix pattern matching.

ML: Add option to scan locally attached network without requiring IP range.
Get IP address and netmask of interface and generate range from that.

Allow changing of the local interface MAC address.
   for (i=0; i<6; i++) {
      net->dev.ifr_hwaddr.sa_data[i] = mac->byte[i];
   }
   if (ioctl(net->sock, SIOCSIFHWADDR, &net->dev) < 0) {
      perror ("ERROR: Can't change MAC: interface up or not permission");
      return -1;
   }

Support all three common forms of Ethernet hardware address:
1) 01-23-45-67-89-ab
2) 01:23:45:67:89:ab
3) 0123.4567.89ab
