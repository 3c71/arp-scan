Code tidy up: reduce the number of global variables.

Additional ARP fingerprinting options, e.g. arpsha != srcaddr.

Some OSes, e.g. OpenBSD and NetBSD, don't run man pages through tbl.
There is disagreement about what the first line in the manpage should be.
Solaris 9 says in man(1):
'\" X
Linux sarge says in groff_man(7):
.\" word
In all cases, the letters in word are "e" for eqn, "r" for refer, "t" for tbl.

Why does darwin 7.9 not have prototypes for pcap_datalink_val_to_name(),
pcap_datalink_val_to_description() and pcap_setnonblock() even though the
pcap library contains these functions?  arp-scan compiles with warnings, but
runs OK.

Add support for win32 link-layer send and receive.

Add support for Token Ring.

Support the libpcap sending function pcap_sendpacket() or pcap_inject() when
they are supported by the pcap library.  These two functions are essentially
the same, but pcap_sendpacket() came from WinPcap whereas pcap_inject() came
from OpenBSD.

Use pcap_get_selectable_fd() to get the file descriptor for select().  This
function is not supported on windows.

Investigate response packets >60 bytes long, e.g:
10:27:40.710842 00:11:43:0f:f2:dd > 00:c0:9f:09:b8:db, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 106: arp reply server4.nta-monitor.ad.nta-monitor.com is-at 00:11:43:0f:f2:dd
10:27:40.802358 00:06:d7:55:0f:40 > 00:c0:9f:09:b8:db, ethertype ARP (0x0806), length 64: arp reply maple.nta-monitor.com is-at 00:06:d7:55:0f:40

Review verbose levels, and what gets displayed.

Investigate ARP trailer negotiation, as defined in RFC1122 section 2.3.1,
Trailer Protocol Negotiation: 'the ARP exchange is completed in the usual
manner using the normal IP protocol type, but a host that wants to speak
trailers will send an additional "trailer ARP reply" packet'.  Trailer
encapsulation itself is detailed in RFC 893.

Replace MT19937 PRNG with SFMT19937.

Enable extra GCC warnings: -Wextra if supported (around gcc 3.4, need an autoconf macro), or
-W.

Include warning about the arpspa option that is in the wiki in the man page.  Suggested by Ed Schaller.
