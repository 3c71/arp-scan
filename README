information about installing and using arp-scan.

Installation
------------

You will need the make utility, an ANSI C compiler (for example gcc or clang),
the development header files and libraries, and libpcap version 0.9 or later.

If you want to run the Perl scripts arp-fingerprint, get-oui and get-iab, you
will need to have the Perl interpreter installed.  These scripts were tested
on Perl 5.8 and 5.10, but will probably run on other versions of Perl 5 as well.
In addition, for get-oui and get-iab, you will need the LWP::Simple Perl
module.

arp-scan uses automake and autoconf, so the typical installation process is:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install

You can pass various options to "configure" to control the build and
installation process.  See the file INSTALL for more details.

arp-scan is known to compile and run on the following platforms:

 1. Linux
 2. FreeBSD
 3. OpenBSD
 4. NetBSD
 5. DragonflyBSD
 6. MacOS X
 7. Solaris

All platforms use libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org/) to send the ARP packets
and receive the responses.

The only peice of the code that is implementation-specific is the function to
obtain the interface MAC address. This uses Packet Socket on Linux, BPF on
BSD and DLPI on Solaris.
