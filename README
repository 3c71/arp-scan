Installation
------------

You will need the make utility, an ANSI C compiler (for example gcc), the
development header files and libraries, and libpcap version 0.8 or later.

arp-scan uses automake and autoconf, so the typical installation process is:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ make check
$ make install

You can pass various options to "configure" to control the build and
installation process.  See the file INSTALL for more details.

arp-scan is known to compile and run on the following platforms:

 1. Linux
 2. FreeBSD
 3. OpenBSD
 4. NetBSD
 5. MacOS X (Darwin)

The ARP packets are sent using raw datalink access.  The mechanism for this
varies between platforms, currently Packet Socket (Linux) and BPF (BSD) are
supported.  It is planned to add support for Win32 and DLPI (Solaris) in
future releases.

All platforms use libpcap (http://www.tcpdump.org/) to receive the ARP
responses.

I decided to implement the sending functions directly rather than using libnet
or libdnet because these libraries are not normally installed by default, and
I want to minimise the need to install additional packages.  By contrast,
libpcap is a standard package on most systems.


Documentation
-------------

For usage information, including details of all the options, use:

$ arp-scan --help

More detailed documentation is available in the manual pages: arp-scan(1),
arp-fingerprint(1), get-iab(1), get-oui(1) and mac-vendor(5).


ARP Packet Format
-----------------

The ARP packet format is defined in RFC 826 "An Ethernet Address Resolution
Protocol".  The diagram below shows the entire ARP packet, including the
Ethernet frame header.

In this diagram, each dash (-) represents one bit, with plus (+) marks every
eight bits. The names for the ARP packet fields like "ar$hrd" are taken
from RFC 826.

Ethernet Frame Header:

+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+--------+
| Dest Address                                        |

| Source Address                                      |
