This file gives a brief overview of the major changes between each ether-scan
release.  For more details please read the ChangeLog file.

2006-07-22 arp-scan 1.5:

* Reduced memory usage from 44 bytes per target to 28 bytes.  This reduces
  the memory usage for a Class-B network from 2.75MB to 1.75MB, and a Class-A
  network from 704MB to 448MB.

* Reduced the startup time for large target ranges.  This reduces the startup
  time for a Class-A network from 80 seconds to 15 seconds.

* Added support for FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD and MacOS X (Darwin).

* Improved operation of the --srcaddr option.  Now this will change the
  source hardware address in the Ethernet header without changing the
  interface address.

* Additional fingerprints for arp-fingerprint.

* Improved manual pages.

2006-06-26 arp-scan 1.4:

* Initial public release.  Source distribution only, which will compile and
  run on Linux.
