.SH NAME
arp-fingerprint \- Fingerprint a system using ARP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-fingerprint
.RI [ options ]
.I target
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B arp-fingerprint
fingerprints the specified target host using the ARP protocol.
.PP
It sends various different types of ARP request to the target, and records
which types it responds to. From this, it constructs a fingerprint string
consisting of "1" where the target responded and "0" where it did not.
An example of a fingerprint string is
.IR 01000100000 .
This fingerprint string is then used to lookup the likely target operating system.
.PP
Many of the fingerprint strings are shared by several operating systems, so
there is not always a one-to-one mapping between fingerprint strings and
operating systems. Also the fact that a system's fingerprint matches a certain
operating system (or list of operating systems) does not necesarily mean that
the system being fingerprinted is that operating system, although it is quite
likely. This is because the list of operating systems is not exhaustive; it is
just what I have discovered to date, and there are bound to be operating
systems that are not listed.
.PP
The ARP fingerprint of a system is generally a function of that system's
kernel (although it is possible for the ARP function to be implemented in
user space, it almost never is).
.PP
Sometimes the fact that two different operating systems share a common ARP
fingerprint string points to a re-use of networking code. One example of
this is Windows NT and FreeBSD.
.PP
.B arp-fingerprint
uses
.B arp-scan
to send the ARP requests and receive the replies.
.PP
There are other methods that can be used to fingerprint a system using
.B arp-scan
which can be used in addition to
.BR arp-fingerprint .
These additional methods are not included in
.B arp-fingerprint
either because they are likely to cause disruption to the target system, or
because they require knowledge of the target's configuration that may not
always be available.
.PP
.B arp-fingerprint
is still being developed, and the results should not be relied on. As most
of the ARP requests that it sends are non-standard, it is possible that it
may disrupt some systems, so caution is advised.
.PP
If you find a system that
.B arp-fingerprint
reports as
.IR UNKNOWN ,
and you know what operating system it is running, could you please send
details of the operating system and fingerprint to
.I arp-scan@nta-monitor.com
so I can include it in future versions. Please include the exact version
of the operating system if you know it, as fingerprints sometimes change
between versions.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display a brief usage message and exit.
.TP
.B -v
Display verbose progress messages.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
$ arp-fingerprint 192.168.0.1
192.168.0.1   01000100000     Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6

.SH NOTES
.B arp-fingerprint
is implemented in Perl, so you need to have the Perl interpreter installed on
your system to use it.
.SH BUGS
There is currently no way to pass options to
.B arp-scan
such as which network interface to use. The
.B arp-scan
command line is hard-coded in the
.B arp-fingerprint
source code, and you may need to change this to suit your environment.
