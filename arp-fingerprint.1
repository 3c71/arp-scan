.SH NAME
arp-fingerprint.pl \- Fingerprint a system using ARP
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B arp-fingerprint.pl
.RI [ options ]
.I target
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B arp-fingerprint.pl
fingerprints the specified target host using the ARP protocol.
.PP
It sends various different types of ARP request to the target, and records
which types it responds to. From this, it constructs a fingerprint string
consisting of "1" where the target responded and "0" where it did not. This
fingerprint string is then used to lookup the likely target operating system.
.PP
.B arp-fingerprint.pl
uses
.B arp-scan
to send the ARP requests and receive the replies.
.PP
.B arp-fingerprint.pl
is still being developed, and the results should not be relied on. As most
of the ARP requests that it sends are non-standard, it is possible that it
may disrupt some systems, so caution is advised.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -h
Display a brief usage message and exit.
.TP
.B -v
Display verbose progress messages.
.SH EXAMPLES
.nf
$ arp-fingerprint.pl 192.168.0.1
192.168.0.1   01000100000     Linux 2.2, 2.4, 2.6

.SH BUGS
There is currently no way to pass options to
.B arp-scan
such as which network interface to use. The
.B arp-scan
command line is hard-coded in the
.B arp-fingerprint.pl
source code, and you may need to change this to suit your environment.
