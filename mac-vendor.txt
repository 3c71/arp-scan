# mac-vendor.txt -- Ethernet vendor file for arp-scan
#
# This file contains Ethernet vendor mappings for arp-scan.  These are used
# to determine the vendor for a give Ethernet interface given the MAC address.
#
# Each line of this file contains a MAC-vendor mapping in the form:
#
# <MAC-Prefix><TAB><Vendor>
#
# Where <MAC-Prefix> is the prefix of the MAC address in hex, and <Vendor>
# is the name of the vendor.  The prefix can be of any length, but it must
# contain an even number of hex digits (representing an even number of bytes).
#
# For example:
#
# 010203 would match any MAC address beginning 01:02:03, and
# 01020304 would match any address beginning 01:02:03:04.
#
# Do not include entries from the IEEE OUI or IAB listings, as these are
# already in the files ieee-oui.txt and ieee-iab.txt, which are automatically
# used by arp-scan.  This file is for MAC addresses that are not present in
# the IEEE listings.
#
# The order of entries in this file are not important.
#
# Blank lines and lines beginning with "#" are ignored.
